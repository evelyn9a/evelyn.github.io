    		You will be truly amazed how fast IDM downloads your files. IDM will also
    		repair broken and resume interrupted downloads due to lost connection,

    		Our powerful download engine uses unique algorithms to recieve internet data in a fastest
    	    possible way. IDM will accelarate downloads all times because of its inovative dynamic file
    	    segmentation technology. Unlike other download managers and accelerators, IDM segments
    	    downloads files dinamically during download process, and it reuses available connection
    	    without additional connect and login stages to archieve the best possible acceleration
    	    performance. Our engineers have a lot of experience in download acceleration, and we
    	    constantly improve this download engine since 1999.</td>
